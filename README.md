DS-5360: Case Studies in Data Science

This repository contains work for two separate projects as part of DS-5360, Fall 2020. This root directory contains the `requirements.txt` to install any required Python packages.

**[SNF Analysis](https://github.com/alfredprah/ds_case_team_5/tree/master/snf_analysis)**: Optimization of the staffing policies (on-prem, remote) for Care Coordinators at Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF) in Texas.


**[Tweet Prediction](https://github.com/alfredprah/ds_case_team_5/tree/master/tweet_prediction)**: Used Natural Langauge Processing (NLP) to predict whether a given tweet is related to a real disater or not, based only on the body of the tweet (no username, comments, likes, etc). Created a dashboard for a content moderation team to 'manually review' the least confident predictions.
